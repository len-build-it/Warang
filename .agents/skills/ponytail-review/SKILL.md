  Code review focused exclusively on over-engineering. Finds what to delete:
  reinvented standard library, unneeded dependencies, speculative abstractions,
  dead flexibility. One line per finding: location, what to cut, what replaces
  it. Use when the user says "review for over-engineering", "what can we
  delete", "is this over-engineered", "simplify review", or invokes
  /ponytail-review. Complements correctness-focused review, this one only
  hunts complexity.

Review diffs for unnecessary complexity. One line per finding: location, what
to cut, what replaces it. The diff's best outcome is getting shorter.

## Format

`L<line>: <tag> <what>. <replacement>.`, or `<file>:L<line>: ...` for
multi-file diffs.

Tags:

- `delete:` dead code, unused flexibility, speculative feature. Replacement: nothing.
- `stdlib:` hand-rolled thing the standard library ships. Name the function.
- `native:` dependency or code doing what the platform already does. Name the feature.
- `yagni:` abstraction with one implementation, config nobody sets, layer with one caller.
- `shrink:` same logic, fewer lines. Show the shorter form.

## Examples

❌ "This EmailValidator class might be more complex than necessary, have you
considered whether all these validation rules are needed at this stage?"

✅ `L12-38: stdlib: 27-line validator class. "@" in email, 1 line, real validation is the confirmation mail.`

✅ `L4: native: moment.js imported for one format call. Intl.DateTimeFormat, 0 deps.`

✅ `repo.py:L88: yagni: AbstractRepository with one implementation. Inline it until a second one exists.`

✅ `L52-71: delete: retry wrapper around an idempotent local call. Nothing replaces it.`

✅ `L30-44: shrink: manual loop builds dict. dict(zip(keys, values)), 1 line.`

## Scoring

End with the only metric that matters: `net: -<N> lines possible.`

If there is nothing to cut, say `Lean already. Ship.` and stop.

## Boundaries

Scope: over-engineering and complexity only. Correctness bugs, security holes,
and performance are explicitly out of scope. Route them to a normal review
pass, not this one. A single smoke test or `assert`-based
self-check is the ponytail minimum, not bloat, never flag it for deletion.
Does not apply the fixes, only lists them.
"stop ponytail-review" or "normal mode": revert to verbose review style.

## Guidelines

- Never use the em dash "—".
  Use plain dash "-" instead.
- When writing commit messages, NEVER auto-add your agent name as co-author.
- Never manually modify CHANGELOG.md files or any files that are marked as auto-generated.
- When writing or substantially editing long Markdown files, put each full sentence on its own line.
  Preserve normal Markdown structure, but avoid wrapping multiple sentences onto one physical line.
- When making technical decisions, do not give much weight to development cost.
  Instead, prefer quality, simplicity, robustness, scalability, and long term maintainability.
- When doing bug fixes, always start with reproducing the bug in an E2E setting as closely aligned with how an end user would use it.
  This makes sure you find the real problem so your fix will actually solve it.
- When end-to-end testing a product, be picky about the UI you see and be obsessed with pixel perfection.
  If something clearly looks off, even if it is not directly related to what you are doing, try to get it fixed along.
- Apply that same high standard to engineering excellence: lint, test failures, and test flakiness.
  If you see one, even if it is not caused by what you are working on right now, still get it fixed.
